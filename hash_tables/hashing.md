# Hashing
- Hashing is a technique used in computer science to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, 
- typically for the purpose of creating efficient data structures like hash tables. 
- The process involves using a hash function to convert input data (such as strings, numbers, or objects) into a numerical value called a hash code or hash value.
- This hash code is then used as an index to store or retrieve data in a hash table or other data structures.

## How Hashing Works
- Hash Function: A hash function takes an input (often called a key) and produces a hash code, typically an integer.
  - The hash function should ideally generate unique hash codes for distinct inputs,
  - but collisions (where different inputs produce the same hash code) can occur.

- Hash Table: A hash table is a data structure that uses hash codes as indices to store and retrieve data efficiently.
  - Each hash code corresponds to a bucket or slot in the hash table, and data is stored or retrieved based on its hash code.

- Collision Handling: Collisions occur when different inputs produce the same hash code.
  - Hash tables typically employ techniques such as chaining (using linked lists or other data structures to store multiple values with the same hash code in the same bucket) or open addressing (finding alternative slots to store colliding values) to handle collisions.

## Hashing in Dart
- Dart provides built-in support for hashing through the hashCode property and the == operator.
- When implementing hashing in Dart, you'll typically override the hashCode method along with the == operator for custom classes to ensure that instances with the same values produce the same hash code.

## Conclusion
- Hashing is a fundamental concept in computer science used for various purposes, including data storage, cryptography, and data retrieval. 
- In Dart, hashing is implemented through hash functions, hash codes, and hash tables. 
- Understanding how to implement and utilize hashing effectively can lead to more efficient and scalable software solutions.
