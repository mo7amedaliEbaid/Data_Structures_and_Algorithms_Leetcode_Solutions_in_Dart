# Recursion 
- Recursion is an approach to solving problems using a function that calls itself as a subroutine.

- A recursive function should have the following properties so that it does not result in an infinite loop:
  - A simple base case (or cases) â€” a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer.
  - A set of rules, also known as recurrence relation that reduces all other cases towards the base case.
