- The stack data structure is identical in concept to a physical stack of objects. When you add an item to a stack, you place it on top of the stack. When you remove an item from a stack, you always remove the top-most item.
- There are only two essential operations for a stack:
    - push : Add an element to the top of the stack.
    - pop : Remove the top element of the stack.
- push and pop are both constant-time operations.
- A stack is known as a LIFO (last-in-first-out) data structure. Elements that are pushed in last are the first ones to be popped out.
