### Array is one of the fundamental blocks in data structure. Since a string is just formed by an array of characters, they are both similar.

# Array
- An array is a basic data structure to store a collection of elements sequentially. But elements can be accessed randomly since each element in the array can be identified by an array index.
- An array can have one or more dimensions. Here we start with the `one-dimensional` array, which is also called the linear.
- an array has a fixed capacity and we need to specify the size of the array when we initialize it.
- Sometimes this will be somewhat inconvenient and wasteful.

- Therefore, most programming languages offer built-in `dynamic array` which is still a random access list data structure but with variable size. 
- For example, we have `vector` in C++ and `ArrayList` in Java.
