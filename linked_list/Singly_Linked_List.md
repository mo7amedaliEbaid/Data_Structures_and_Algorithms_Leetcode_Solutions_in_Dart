- Each node in a singly-linked list contains not only the value but also a `reference field` to link to the next node. By this way, the singly-linked list organizes all the nodes in a sequence.
- In most cases, we will use the `head` node (the first node) to represent the whole list.
- Unlike the array, we are not able to access a random element in a singly-linked list in constant time.
- If we want to get the i^th element, we have to traverse from the head node one by one. It takes us O(N) time on average to `visit an element by index`, where N is the length of the linked list.
