// Create a function that removes all occurrences of a specific element from a linked
// list. The implementation is similar to the removeAfter method that you
// implemented earlier. For example:
// // original list
// 1 -> 3 -> 3 -> 3 -> 4
// // list after removing all occurrences of 3
// 1 -> 4

// This solution traverses down the list, removing all nodes that match the element you
// want to remove. Each time you perform a removal, you need to reconnect the
// predecessor node with the successor node. While this can get complicated, itâ€™s well
// worth it to practice this technique. Many data structures and algorithms will rely on
// clever uses of pointer arithmetic.
// There are a few cases you need to consider. The first case to consider is when the
// head of the list contains the value that you want to remove.
