# Basic Data Structures in Dart
## List.
- A list is a general-purpose, generic container for storing an ordered collection of elements, and itâ€™s used commonly in all sorts of Dart programs. In many other programming languages, this data type is called an array.
- Dart defines List as an abstract class with methods for accessing and modifying the elements of the collection by index.
```dart
final people = ['Pablo', 'Manda', 'Megan'];
```
